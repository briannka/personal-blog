# What is this project

The personal blog is built using HTML and CSS only. It's a project from the Front-end developer course by Udacity, which is successfully graduated from in 2020.

## Purpose

Demonstrate HTML and CSS knowledge by building a personal blog with a theme of choice. I chose the travel theme, however, the text in the blog is mostly [cupcake ipsum](http://www.cupcakeipsum.com/).
